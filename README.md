# Frames.js Starter Kit with examples

This is a boilerplate template to get started quickly with `frames.js`

## Quickstart

If running from the frames.js repository itself:

- Run `yarn` from the repository root
- Run `cd templates/next-starter-with-examples`

1. Install dependencies `yarn install`

2. Run `yarn dev` to run the server and debugger, this will also open the debugger automatically in your browser.

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

4. Edit `app/page.tsx`

5. Visit [http://localhost:3000/examples](http://localhost:3000/examples) to see the list of examples.

6. (Optional) To use a real signer (costs warps), copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in the env variables following the comments provided
